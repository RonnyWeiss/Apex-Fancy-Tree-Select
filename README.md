This Plug-in is used to draw a FancyTree with select option. Selected nodes can be set into different APEX items. It has also the option to use it as read only tree and you can cache large trees in local storage on the client to save loading the data each time you refresh a page with the same tree. It's also possible to filter the tree with a search field.

The Plug-ins also supports different events:

*   **Expand Parents of selected Nodes all:** $("#static-tree-region-id-of-the-tree-region").trigger("expandSelected");
*   **Expand all:** $("#static-tree-region-id-of-the-tree-region").trigger("expandAll");
*   **Collapse all:** $("#static-tree-region-id-of-the-tree-region").trigger("collapseAll");
*   **Select all:** $("#static-tree-region-id-of-the-tree-region").trigger("selectAll");
*   **Unselect all:** $("#static-tree-region-id-of-the-tree-region").trigger("unselectAll");
*   **expand Tree to a specific Level (When you left data then configJSON is used):** $("#static-tree-region-id-of-the-tree-region").trigger("expandToLevel", 3);

The tree also supports apexbeforerefresh and apexafterefresh event that are available in dynamic actions.
