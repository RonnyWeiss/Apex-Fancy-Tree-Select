This Plug-in is used to draw a FancyTree with select option. Selected nodes can be set into different APEX items. It has also the option to use it as read only tree and you can cache large trees in local storage on the client to save loading the data each time you refresh a page with the same tree. It's also possible to filter the tree with a search field.
